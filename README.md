## **Project Description**:

- [SpaceNeon](https://github.com/DavidPVaz/SpaceNeon) is an open source game developed in 10 days by @FranciscoInacio, 
@AshDrumish, @mcmatos, @PauloPatoleia and myself. This project was a challenge presented to us during the <Academia de CÃ³digo_>
bootcamp that lasted 14 weeks from January 2019 to April 2019, and all of us had zero programming experience or any related 
knowledge. This game was developed with 3 weeks of programming "experience", and dit not come into full completion due to lack
of time, experience and scalable/maintainable/design notions.

- With Java as my language of choice, I've decided to refactor the code, and in this project I present a complete, 
scalable and maintainable version of the game. Beside some design decisions (State, Strategy, Singleton, Factory), I've also
used some features of Java 8 (Stream API, Lambda Expression and Method Reference) and Java 5 (Varargs). For more, just look at 
the code, please.

#### **About**:

- This game has a **single-player**, **two-player** and **versus** mode. In both single and two-player, fight against waves of 
enemies spaceships that will grow in number as you increase your score! Feel free to collect power-ups to ease your ride 
(increase player speed, increase bullet speed, increase bullet damage, switch to double shooting and extra life). 

- You are not a cat, so you only have 3 lives! Each time you lose your life, you also lose all power-up enhancements collected 
until then, and your state is reseted back to the beginning. If you're tough, and get to 3000 score points, the waves will 
disappear and a final boss will spawn, and as this get closest to his death, it will begin to move and shoot faster. Don't say
I didn't warn you! 

- You also want to be aware of your shots while in two-player mode, since your bullets kill your "friend". But if you really want
to shoot him, just move to versus mode and solve those issues!

#### **Possible enhancements**:

- [ ] Create the images, and add a life bar to final boss
- [ ] Create more type of attacks to final boss
- [ ] Refine the values of the enemies and power-up spawn logic

#### **To play the game**:
- Clone the project and run ant with the build.xml to create the jar.
- Just download it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UgTA54ZEfFO5BHxKHRGcXLvqi-oIu2Kw).
