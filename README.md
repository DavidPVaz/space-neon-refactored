## **Project Description**:

- [SpaceNeon](https://github.com/DavidPVaz/SpaceNeon) is an open source game developed in 10 days by @FranciscoInacio, 
@AshDrumish, @mcmatos, @PauloPatoleia and myself. This project was a challenge presented to us during the <Academia de CÃ³digo_>
bootcamp that lasted 14 weeks from January 2019 to April 2019, and all of us had zero programming experience or any related 
knowledge. This game was developed with 4 weeks of programming "experience", and dit not come into full completion due to lack
of time, experience and scalable/maintainable/design notions.

- With Java as my language of choice, I've decided to refactor the code and in this project, I present a more complete,
 scalable and maintainable version of the game. Beside some design decisions (State, Strategy, Singleton, Factory), I've 
 also used some features of Java 8 (Stream API, Lambda Expression and Method Reference) and Java 5 (Varargs). 
 For more, just look at the code, please.

#### **Possible enhancements**:

- [ ] Create the images, and add a life bar to final boss
- [ ] Create more type of attacks to final boss
- [ ] Refine the values of the enemies and power-up spawn logic

#### **To play the game**:
- Clone the project and run ant with the build.xml to create the jar.
- Go to release tab and download it.
